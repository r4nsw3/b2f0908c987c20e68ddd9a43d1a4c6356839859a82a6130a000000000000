  |   Just like Kirby, INTERNAL tag because it comes free with a Nintendo   |
  |   online subscription. We know you love SNES classics, no way you can   |
  |   miss them. And you definitely want us to support future updates.      |
  |   Also, JAP version too because the Japan-only versions are often       |
  |   different in difficulty and play mechanics so its worth checking      |
  |   out.                                                                  |
